It's easier to maintain&#8203;Why are you on here?To find women&#8203;Any woman?No, of course not. I have requirements.&#8203;Which are?Dec 16, 2015 6:02pmIt's not a fixed set... but I want to be able to have a good conversation and hear opinions. She has to be independent, as a person.

 Don't know if I can trust you now.I was counting on you knowing that it's not true.&#8203;You aren't sincere.I like sincere.I understand. &#8203;That's a harsh judgement after one occurrence.&#8203;So don't let it happen again.I'm looking for a man.
Not a child.Dec 16, 2015 6:41pmI see&#8203;My name is Massimo. Not Jean.&#8203;Dec 16, 2015 8:24pmMassimo sounds better.Dec 16, 2015 10:18pmThank you.&#8203;Dec 16, 2015 11:00pmWhat's your type physically?Dec 17, 2015 11:33amIt's about proportions.

What are you looking for?Dec 17, 2015 3:41pmI'm looking for: excitement, passion,  experience, pleasure, warmth, romance, enthusiasm, satisfaction, goosebumps, , comfort, inspiration, compassion, suspense... someone to make life more interesting.&#8203;Very precise.Can I add for me...
Intensity
Desire
AttentionVery good. These are gladly welcomed to the list&#8203;LolNo J gf?By the way. These are intended not only to be consumed, but also to be provided&#8203;No&#8203;Naturally.Describe your good and bad points.I'm married (still) to a Japanese. Separated.&#8203;Ha ha
Me too.Add connection to the list.
We don't get it from them.Bad: I can be messy and lazy&#8203;Good: passionate, imaginative, sometimes romantic&#8203;Your turn for a question.Seems to be always me.I learned a lot about you from your questions&#8203;Dec 17, 2015 3:57pmOkay: Ballerinas out heels?&#8203;Flats but heels when I feel sexy.Is that what you mean?My turn.
Best part of the female body.Difficult... give me a minute&#8203;I really have a hard time coming up with just one part. &#8203;Legs&#8203;Yes you did...I think to me, legs define the look significantly&#8203;I see.Dec 17, 2015 4:12pmWhat about a man's body?&#8203;Mouth and hands.Kissing important and hands to control me.I like using my mouth. And I like touching&#8203;Holding and grabbing&#8203;And height important too.
With sincerity.;)About 80kg right now&#8203;Doesn't mean anything to me.
BMI24&#8203;Does that help?&#8203;If you aren't lying about your height you are borderline.If I disappeared for a while it is because I have an English conversation lesson for an hour. &#8203;Borderline what?&#8203;You are learning English?
Borderline of being overweight.No, teaching. Oh, really. My doctors always told me I should aim for 75kg&#8203;5 to go then.
You have until I return.Dec 17, 2015 4:27pmYes, I'm 183cm/6foot/72inch&#8203;With Christmas and new year in between?&#8203;Ha ha
Ok then...just don't go more than 80Dec 17, 2015 4:48pmI'll do my best.&#8203;Going out.
One last q from you.Dec 17, 2015 5:19pmMy last question: when will you reveal more of you to me?&#8203;Visually...&#8203;Dec 17, 2015 11:27pmGood nightDec 18, 2015 6:10pmWhat would you like me to look like?Dec 18, 2015 7:03pmLike yourself.&#8203;Of course.
Dark features....exquisite bone structure.Sounds good&#8203;You said you like to be controlled. What about restraints? &#8203;Dec 18, 2015 10:17pmMental control comes first...Dec 19, 2015 8:16amTrust?&#8203;I like a man who tells me what to do.Dec 19, 2015 8:54amBut not just any man, I guess&#8203;Dec 19, 2015 10:25amIn this case I expect that you are good at following instructions&#8203;Dec 19, 2015 2:47pmA man who I have connection with..and yes if he can overcome my defiance I will obey.Dec 19, 2015 4:35pmThat is good to know.&#8203;On a unrelated subject, I'd prefer to change to a more convenient method of communication. Do you use Line?&#8203;NoGetting new iPhone in January.... Until then just this.I see.&#8203;Dec 19, 2015 4:50pmDo you like exercising control?Yes, often silently through physical cues&#8203;Liking that.And I need to know that my partner enjoys this.&#8203;Does that make sense? I'm not sure if this is the right explanation.&#8203;It makes perfect sense.In my 'quest' for pleasure I also want to provide pleasure and satisfaction.&#8203;Dec 19, 2015 5:08pmHow do you exercise control?By withholding, demanding or physically by holding, pushing, restraining&#8203;I need to feel a certain emotion.
That of a rabbit.Rabbit?&#8203;What does a rabbit feel when hunted?Fear&#8203;Fear for its life&#8203;Yes.
Fear.How about pain?&#8203;Fear can be delivered in many ways...
A look, gesture, word..action.Dec 19, 2015 5:24pmFear is very individual. Everybody is afraid of something else to varying degrees.&#8203;I will have to find yours&#8203;Just fear.
Of a man.I'm usually friendly and easy going. But there is an animal inside me and sometimes it needs to get out.&#8203;Let men be men.Dec 19, 2015 5:40pmTell me a situation from the past that you wish you could relive&#8203;When an ex boyfriend slapped me hard across the face.
:)That image turns me on&#8203;Dec 19, 2015 5:57pmAdrenaline!!!Imagining the look on your face, how you flinch when I raise my hand again&#8203;Mmmmm.Anticipation.
Love it.Dec 19, 2015 6:14pmBut that time I might not slap you&#8203;I will not let you let your gard down&#8203;I think we have connected!That's good to hear&#8203;Dec 19, 2015 6:31pmI had these desires for a while... difficult to find someone to realize them&#8203;Dec 20, 2015 6:39pmLet me know when it is a good time to catch you&#8203;Dec 20, 2015 10:41pmLiking the new profile pic..Glad you like it. I had some inspiration&#8203;Dec 20, 2015 11:31pmHope I am bringing about the change!Dec 21, 2015 7:15amYes, of course it's you.&#8203;You are the inspiration of many of my thoughts these days.&#8203;Dec 21, 2015 7:48amNice to know.Dec 21, 2015 8:44amI can't wait to fill in the blanks with an actual image of you&#8203;Dec 21, 2015 4:08pmAnd me of you....You look so different in all your pics.I guess it's a 'talent' and a requirement for my job&#8203;Well hello Mr Jekkyl/HydeWhich one are you today?Casual. Shopping for dinner...&#8203;I see nothing I like here, and the food is not exciting either&#8203;Are you a good cook?Decent, I guess&#8203;Yeah..the food is al the same.
No pushing the bounderies...Food is important to me. So I can be passionate about it&#8203;I love Italian.You will love at least half of me in this case&#8203;Proper al dente pasta and a real wood oven.
And lots of red wine of course.Mmmm. You are half Italian ?Yes, I'm half Italian&#8203;Dec 21, 2015 4:23pmThe passionate side&#8203;Lol
Of course.I lived in Italy for 5 years.Where?&#8203;RomeMy family has a house near Lucca.&#8203;Do you look at women the way Italian men look at women?Maybe...&#8203;I have a vivid fantasy&#8203;Dec 21, 2015 4:39pmWhich is...It depends on the situation&#8203;Yes..It's so wild and windy today.
Untamable.I love it.Oh... you're putting me on the spot&#8203;It's grey.&#8203;?I can enjoy any weather if I get into the right mood&#8203;Sorry... this app is not updating messages&#8203;Makes it a bit hard to keep a conversation going&#8203;Dec 21, 2015 4:59pmDo you know any good Italian restaurants?I knew a very good one, but the chef left&#8203;Do you?&#8203;Yes... There's a good one in aoyama.
2 Italian brothers own it.Nappolimania.Dec 21, 2015 5:14pmI think I can trust your judgement since you lived in Italy&#8203;Or Da Isa in nakameguro is supposed to be good. Italian chef.I have been lookin for good pizza.&#8203;Me too.
And red wine served at room temperature.Ha, good one. Yes!&#8203;I was in Milano with my parents in August. * sigh *&#8203;Lucky.I fondly remember the dinner we had&#8203;Dec 21, 2015 5:29pmWhen were you in Italy the last time?&#8203;About 10 years ago...Too long.Yeah. That's long.&#8203;I go see my family once, twice a year&#8203;But I haven't give to Italy as much as I like to&#8203;That's a long haul from Tokyo.You wouldn't go back to live there?I got my life set up here, it would be difficult to move back at this point&#8203;True.Dec 21, 2015 5:46pmBut, I've been thinking about it&#8203;Tokyo too easy to live in though.That is the 'problem'&#8203;And I can't get work as easy as here in Europe&#8203;True. Me too.And the food is good. It's clean. And... all that&#8203;All the same thoughts as me..Dec 21, 2015 6:02pmOne thing was missing though&#8203;What's that?Passion. &#8203;Enthusiasm.&#8203;Desire.&#8203;Life.You can put it that way&#8203;The Japanese are robots.Dec 21, 2015 6:18pmI don't mind robot, as long as they have and show feelings.&#8203;Impossible for them.
They are programmed differently to us.Apparently.&#8203;I can deal with it in a public setting, not on an intimate one&#8203;Yes.
That's why we are both on here.*in&#8203;I would compare sex with a Japanese woman as having sex with a dead fish&#8203;Ha haDec 21, 2015 6:40pmYou need to get that new phone.&#8203;Indeed.Then I can get rid of this account&#8203;Ok.
If you delete now then you've lost me forever....That's why it's still there&#8203;LolDec 21, 2015 6:55pmI'll be in Taiwan for new year's&#8203;When are you back?On the 1st&#8203;Ok.

So windy here in Edinburgh!It was raining all night here. Today the temperature will go up to 14!&#8203;Lying in bed in one of the many bedrooms in my brothers luxury house....listening to the gales outside.Feeling like a queen.Where's my king?I'd enjoy that.&#8203;Dec 24, 2015 9:12amI'd like to make the queen make me feel like a king&#8203;I need TLCLet's cuddle then.&#8203;Mmmm.
